# Deep Learning
## Flowers Images Classifier 

### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build an image classifier by using Pytorch python library. The classifier takes flowers images and uses a pre-trained deep learning model in order to classify the different species of flowers in the dataset. 

### Code

The code is provided in the `Image Classifier Project.html` file. 

The project also includes four files `train.py`, `predict.py`, `dl_classifier.py` and `image_preprocessing.py`. The first file, `train.py`, will train a new network on a dataset and save the model as a checkpoint. The second file, `predict.py`, uses a trained network to predict the class for an input image. The third file, `image_preprocessing.py`, contains code that is related to preprocessing images. The fourth file, `dl_classifier.py`, contains functions for creating the deep learning model. These four files also can be used to run the model.
